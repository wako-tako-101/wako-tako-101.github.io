            <div>Hello and welcome! My name is Warrick Brugal and I am a 19 year-old UF student. I'm currently majoring in Digital Arts and Sciences at the College of the Arts, and I aim to minor in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (Computer Science). <br>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and decided to study at UF Digital Worlds to pursue a career of game design/development. Growing up, I grew accustomed to playing video games and I always desired to transition from a gamer to a maker and be able to enlighten people with digital expeirences.
